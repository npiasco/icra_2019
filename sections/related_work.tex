\vspace{4pt}\noindent\textbf{Image descriptor for outdoor visual localization.} Original image descriptors for image retrieval in the context of image localization are built by combining sparse features with an aggregation method, such as BoW or VLAD. Specific features re-weighting scheme dedicated to image localization have been introduced in~\cite{Arandjelovic2014}. Authors of~\cite{Sattler2016} introduce a re-ranking routine to improve the localization performances on large-scale outdoor area. More recently, \cite{Arandjelovic2017} introduces NetVLAD, a convolutional neural network that is trained to learn a well suited image representation for image localization. NetVLAD uses a fully convolutional encoder to extract from an input image dense feature maps. These maps are then send through a trainable pooling layer that builds the final descriptor. Numerous other CNN image descriptors have been proposed in the literature~\cite{Kim2017a,Gordo2017,Radenovic2017,Sunderhauf2015a,Liu2018} and achieve state of the art localization results. Therefore we use CNN image descriptors as base component in our system.
