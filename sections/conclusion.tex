\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have introduced a new competitive global image descriptor designed for image-based localization under challenging conditions. Our descriptor handle visual changes between images by learning the geometry of the scene. Strength of our method remains in the fact that it needs geometric information only during the learning procedure. Our trained descriptor is then used on image only. We show that our proposal is much more efficient than state-of-the-art localization methods~\cite{Arandjelovic2017, Radenovic2017} even on methods based on side information learning~\cite{Hoffman2016}. Our descriptor performs especially well for challenging cross-season localization scenario, therefore it can be used to solve long-term place recognition problem. We additionally obtain encouraging results for night to day image retrieval.

In a future work we will investigate the use of other modalities as side information sources, like the reflectance factor provided by lidars. We also want to study the generalization capability of our system, by considering a different image-based localization task like direct pose regression~\cite{Brachmann2018}.
