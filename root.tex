\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present a new training with side modality framework to enhance image-based localization. The localization is performed by extracting a compact global image descriptor from a convolutional neural network. In order to learn side modality information, we train a fully convolutional decoder network that transfers from one modality to another.

Experiments show that our system is able to enhance a purely image-based system by properly learning appearance of a side modality.
